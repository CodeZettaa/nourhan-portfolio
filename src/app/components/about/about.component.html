          I'm a Senior / Staff Frontend Engineer at <strong>Almatar</strong>, a travel-tech company
          where I've been a foundational member for around 8 years. I work on large Angular
          monorepos and complex products spanning B2C, B2B, and internal tools, specializing in
          frontend architecture, clean code patterns, and performance optimization.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond building production applications, I'm passionate about teaching and mentoring. I
          teach JavaScript and frontend development at leading institutions including
          <strong>ITI (Information Technology Institute)</strong>, <strong>Route Academy</strong>, and
          <strong>Elevate Egypt</strong>, helping developers go from zero to advanced.

        <p>
          I also run <strong>CodeZetta</strong>, my educational brand where I create content on
          YouTube, TikTok, and other platforms. My deep-dive series like "JS Hero" and "سكريبتها
          صح" break down complex JavaScript internals, Angular concepts, and frontend architecture
          in an accessible, story-driven way.
